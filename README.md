### Prerequisites

You will need to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the pygame package, only for visualization.
* To install pygame just use pip
  ```sh
  pip install pygame
  ```
### Journey
The project is far from being done, but the aim is not to have a pretty GUI, rather to have a fully working algorithm that solves the puzzle.
